- Thank you to Tolga Ercan, and to everyone at Vetster, for making this meet-up happen!

## 
Welcome to our first meet-up of the 2025-'26 season. And, to our first meet-up devoted to AI+PHP.

AI is the most unusual topic I have ever had to organize in my five (six?) years of organizing both LTO and GTA-PHP:

(a) Speakers from companies are shilling their wares so hard, that it is actually a real risk that they will turn off our wonderful attendees. We have endured plenty of sales pitches, but AI is "off the charts"

(b) The pace of AI in 2025 is so fast, and the money chasing AI is so astronomical, that, in a strange way, there are no experts. There are no teachers, only students.

(c) I am of the very strong opinion that we will become impatient with our traditional presentation format for AI topics.

(d) I am of the very strong opinion that our own experiences with AI+PHP is the most compelling meet-up topic.

My suggestion: our corporate host takes the podium to let us know what they are doing with AI+PHP. This, then, starts a round table styled discussion. Occasionally, someone takes the podium to go through specific websites and repos.

Vetster has a very interesting AI job posting (https://careers.vetster.com/p/9aa35f41ae43-senior-ai-engineer) -- and, also a Laravel job posting (https://careers.vetster.com/p/78b2e240985b-technical-lead-backend-laravel). The two people who are referred to by name in both postings are usually at our meet-ups at Vetster. And, are likely to be at this one.

Their AI job posting is a fantastic starting point to hear about your specific experiences with AI+PHP. And, if it turns out that this is how a new career experience starts...

This is specifically not a corporate recruiting event. There are no actual job interviews.

Sure, this meet-up is blurring the lines. A while ago, we had a York Region PHP meet-up at a recruiting firm's office, and that one left me with the proverbial "bad taste". There have been a few companies hosting meet-ups, over the years, when they were in need of PHP devs, some literally plucking attendees out of the boardroom mid-meet-up. Many such companies are mysteriously not available to host meet-ups when they do not have a need.

IMO, this job posting is a "Sign of the Times". We are fortunate that, not only is the company posting the job, a local Laravel shop, but a long-time stalwart supporter of our Laravel open source community. So, we can, and should, indulge in some line blurring.

Schedule:
- 6:00pm to 7:00pm: meet-and-greet
- 7:00pm to 9:00pm: AI+PHP+Laravel

I am looking forward to seeing you! It has been a while!

-Bob Bloom
